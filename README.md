# Causal Relationships and Programming Outcomes: A Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Experiment (ICSE'24)

## Replication Package

We include independent data analysis scripts from two researchers with an overlap in the RQs: 
`analysis_scripts_1` investigates RQs 1,2,4; `analysis_scripts_2` investigates RQs 1,3,4. Both script subdirectories have associated readme files for ease of result replication.

We also include the study stimuli shown to participants. Details of our pre-registered hypotheses and data analysis methods can be found at https://osf.io/m4p6e.

Further questions about the replication materials can be directed to Hammad Ahmad (hammada@umich.edu), Madeline Endres (endremad@umich.edu), or Westley Weimer (weimerw@umich.edu).
